==============

This is the source code behind [wncc-iitb.org][], the community website for Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay.  
[wncc-iitb.org]: http://wncc-iitb.org/

What makes the website unique is it is maintained by the entire community and not just the admin group of the club.

Being a club focussed on programming, we felt the best way to develop a collaborative and well maintained website is by allowing people to add content as and when necessary.
But there is a twist, we add content via sending pull requests.

Its a strange way to add content, isn't it? But you are a dev right? Pull Requests should be a breeze.

Not exactly familiar with using github?

* Try [Basic Github Usage](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you feel quite familiar with creating/sending a pull request, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/wncc/wncc.github.io/wiki/_pages) for adding various types of content:

The most frequent zone where you will add content will be [Community Hack](http://wncc-iitb.org/hacks/)
The [community hack-wiki](https://github.com/wncc/wncc.github.io/wiki/Adding-a-Community-Hack) gives more specific details of adding your own hack.
