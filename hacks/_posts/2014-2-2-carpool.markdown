Our carpool app is designed to connect the remote travellers.
We observe that usually the only one seat is occupied by the car owner and the rest of the seats are vacant in most of the cases.

The car owner can set a fare for going from point A to point B, hence he can make a few bucks while carpooling.

This will significantly reduce the burden on public transport in India.

On the basis of the locations entered by the user, carpool will recommend the people nearby having the same destination.

Features :
---------

1. Simple Inteface
2. Car Owner can charge a fare
3. predefined locations in Mumbai.


Future Plans:
------------
Future updates will contain Google Map Api integration for a User friendly map for entering locations.
