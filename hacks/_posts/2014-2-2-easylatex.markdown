Our hack allows easy creation and use of LaTeX templates.



Features :
---------
EasyLaTeX allows easy creation of LaTeX templates which is used by the server to autmatically generate an html form that takes appropriate input and uses this input to generate the output latex code according to the template used.

Instructions:
------------

1. Go to home page. Choose one of the many templates displayed there.
2. Fill the form shown.
3. Click Output PDF if you want just the PDF or Latex source if you want to view and modify the LaTeX source

To create new template:
1. The easiest way is to use an old template and modify it.
2. URL is : template.php?load=old
3. After creating the template click create and it will show the pdf with some dummy values filled in.

Future Plans:

1. Add help for the template language

3. Dynamically adding fields if required
4. Host the website
