Currently hosted [here](http://home.iitb.ac.in/~manishg/Stuff/timetable/).

The timetable generator lets one input course details and get a personal timetable, which can be printed. 
This timetable can also be shared with the permalink option. 
A permalinked timetable can be locally edited so others with a similar course plan can make their timetable by modifying yours.


###Upcoming features

 - ASC integration for fetching slots/venues
 - Ability to use app to schedule extra lectures
 - Various usability tweaks
