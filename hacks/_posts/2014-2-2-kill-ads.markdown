Our KillAds chrome extension aims at removing all ads from a web page, thus making it easier to surf the web.



Features :
---------

1. Removes almost all ads
2. Easy to use (User only has to enable extension in chrome://extensions for it to work)

Instructions:
------------

1. Download the zip file from above link.
2. Extract all files in a new folder.
3. Open chrome and go to chrome://extensions
4. Check Developer mode checkbox next to heading.
5. Click on "Load unpacked extensions"
6. Select the folder to which you extracted the files.
7. Click "Enable" next to "Kill Ads" extension. Now enjoy ad-free surfing!

Future Plans:
------------
We plan to add a browser action to the extension so that the user can easily pause/resume the extension.

We also plan to include code to remove video ads, such as those before youtube videos.

We may also add a 'report problem' link so that the user may report(say via e-mail) if the user finds any bugs.
